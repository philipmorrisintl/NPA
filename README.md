# NPA - Network Perturbation Amplitude

The NPA (Network Perturbation Amplitude) and BIF (Biological Impact Factor)
methods allow to understand the mechanisms behind and predict the effect of
exposure based on transcriptomics datasets. This approach enables to translate
the gene expression fold-changes into differential values for each network
node, and to summarize this at the network level to provide a quantitative
assessment of the degree of perturbation of the network model, the Network
Perturbation Amplitude (NPA). Combining multiple relevant network models,
the overall biological impact of a perturbing agent, the Biological Impact
Factor (BIF), can be calculated by aggregating individual NPA scores.
